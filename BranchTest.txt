Hello, Git user! 👋

This file was created to test branching in Git. 
Branches allow you to develop features independently without affecting the main branch.

Here are some Git branching tips:

1. Create a new branch: 
   ➡️  `git checkout -b new-feature`

2. Switch between branches:
   ➡️  `git checkout main`

3. Merge your branch with the main branch:
   ➡️  `git merge new-feature`

Happy coding! 🚀✨
